#summary Using the Google API PHP Client library.
#sidebar TableOfContents

Now that you've got a copy of the library, and included the files in your script, you're ready to start using it!

First you need to initialize the client, and Google Plus service:

{{{
$client = new Google_Client();
$plus = new Google_PlusService($client);
// And then you need to authenticate the user using the OAuth flow, which you do by:

// If a oauth token was stored in the session, use that- and otherwise go through the oauth dance
if (isset($_SESSION['token'])) {
  $client->setAccessToken($_SESSION['token']);
} else {
  // In a real application this would be stored in a database, and not in the session!
  $_SESSION['auth_token'] = $client->authenticate();
}
}}}

Do note you should replace the session storage of the OAuth key with a real storage (on disk, in your mysql database, etc) before releasing your app.

And you're ready to start making calls, for instance to get the consumption stream (activities from the people you follow) in Plus, you can call:

{{{
$activities = $plus->activities->listActivities('me', 'public');
}}}

Next you should read how to use [OAuth2 OAuth2] in your application.
